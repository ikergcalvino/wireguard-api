# Contributing to wireguard-api

Thanks for your interest in improving wireguard-api! Contributions, bug reports and feature requests are all
welcome. This guide covers how the project is organized, how to set up your environment and the conventions it
follows.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug** or **request a feature** by opening an
  [issue](https://github.com/ikergcalvino/wireguard-api/issues/new/choose).
- **Report a security vulnerability** privately, as described in the [security policy](SECURITY.md).
- **Open a pull request** to fix a bug, add a feature, or improve the documentation, the tests or the CI.

## How the code is organized

```
api/
├── main.py           # FastAPI app: middleware, exception handlers and routers
├── routers/          # HTTP layer: one module per resource (interfaces, peers)
├── models/           # Pydantic models and validation patterns
└── services/
    └── wireguard.py  # Every call to wg and wg-quick
```

- **Routers** translate HTTP requests into service calls and service results into responses. They never run
  commands themselves.
- **`services/wireguard.py`** is the only module that runs `wg` or `wg-quick`, always through `_run()`, with an
  argument list and never a shell. Secrets such as private and preshared keys go through stdin, never as
  arguments.
- **The API does not write or parse config files.** `wg-quick` owns the interface lifecycle and the `.conf`
  files; everything else runs against the live kernel state with `wg show` and `wg set`. Please keep it that way.
- **Validate input in the models.** Anything that reaches `wg` must first be checked by a Pydantic validator or a
  path parameter pattern.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikergcalvino/wireguard-api.git
cd wireguard-api

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

make install-dev   # pip install -e . --group dev (needs pip 25.1+)
```

wireguard-api supports Python **3.11** and later. The development tools are
[dependency groups](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-groups/) in `pyproject.toml`
(`lint`, `test`, `type`, and `dev` with all of them), so they are not published with the package.

## Quality checks

CI runs these checks on every push and pull request to `main` and `develop`, with the tests on every supported
Python version, and builds and smoke-tests the Docker image. Run them locally before pushing:

```bash
make check                # all of the below
make lint                 # ruff check and ruff format --check (use `make format` to fix)
make type                 # ty check
make test                 # pytest, with a coverage threshold of 90%
docker compose build      # build the Docker image
```

- Line length is 120 and imports are sorted by ruff.
- pytest turns warnings into errors.
- Tests mock `_run()`, so no WireGuard interface or root access is needed. Add tests for new features and bug
  fixes, at the service level and through the HTTP API.

## Branching and pull requests

- Branch off **`develop`** and target your pull request at **`develop`**. `main` is reserved for releases.
- Keep pull requests focused: one logical change per PR.
- Fill in the PR template and make sure the checks pass before requesting review. If your change modifies or
  removes public API (endpoints, request or response fields, status codes or configuration variables), mark it as
  a breaking change.
- Commit messages follow a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style (`feat:`, `fix:`,
  `docs:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `deps:`, …).
